Introducing you to 'DroidSutra'.

![DroidSutra image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/logo_small.png "Logo")

Our team name is a conciously coined term. From where?

  ... **Droid** from Android and
  
  ... **Sutra** from Sanskrit, which means a set of stringent rules.
  
So, are you up for some *'Sutras of the Droids'*?. Hell yeah! We think it is a cool name.
  
## Meet the team

We are a group of four people coming from South India and fourth one from Pakistan, holding a genuine passion to witness and learn the process of software development and moreover, the hurdles behind it.

**Adarsh Raghoothaman** will handle design tasks of our main application. He always enjoyed the creative space and was all-hands to take up this role despite the fact that he is totally new to App Development and its auxiliaries. 

**Rijin Shaji** wants to learn more about the entire software development process and is also delighted to be part of an Agile project. Though he stumbles upon the numerous tasks ahead of him - especially to maintain and operate on the database, which would be one of the integral parts of this application, he keeps his cool.

**Viju Sudhi** has his flair with words and loves writing accounts of whatever comes his way. Ownage of this blog's design and content goes to him, well supported by the other two team members.

**Faizan Ali** likes to work in a team and cooperate along with other members. His trubleshppting passion will be a key in our development and he will also be handeling some part of designing. 

While rolling out the tasks, we particularly noted that the development of this application - **IMPLEMENTATION** - is no single man's job. It needs deliberate and strenuous efforts from the three of us, owing to the fact that we are totally new to this domain.

Challenges have always been fun and we took them up with a smile on our face. This project is no different. Rolling our sleeves up. *Thanks for the applause, Leute.*

## Our topic of concern

![Bird Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Birds.png "Birds Picture")

We hope, strongly, that by the end of this course we would have a working Android application which would -

... **One**, help the user to gather information about birds.

... **Two**, help him or her to add citation of birds – location, time and activity.

... And **three**, lend him or her extended support with dual modes - expert and beginner.

These three are just to start with, we would certainly have stunning features coming your way.

## How do we connect with each other?

To involve in a development process, the team has to stay well-knit and we know how important it is to deploy multiple modes of communication to ensure a cohesive product.

... **GitHub portal** All thanks to Dr. -Ing Sandro Schulze for having helped us create a common repo from where we could work jointly, hassle-free.

... **Mail threads** We have planned to communicate religiously via the University mail to keep things recorded and evident.

![Communication_MailThreads]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Communication_MailThreads.png "Communication_MailThreads")

... **WhatsApp Group** Random discussions ranging all the way from Weekend parties to MainActivity in Android Studio. Nowhere else but in our very own WhatsApp Group. Any better place to indulge in a productive discussion?

![Communication_WhatsAppGroup]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Communication_WhatsAppGroup.png "Communication_WhatsAppGroup")

... Well yes. Our favourite mode of communication would be one-to-one. And we have **Campus House Room No. 026**. This room is going to be the hub of our design, implementation, conflicts and finally smiles.

## Not just a Plan 'A'. We come with a Plan 'B', as well.

No task comes easy - especially when it is your first. We are certainly nervous of what would be in stock when there is a random change in the requirements or an unexpected hurdle in the course of our App development. What do we do, then, when we have a crisis?

![Plan_A_fails]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Plan_A_fails.png " ")

Digilence is the key and we have articulated certain measures to tackle the issues, if any pop in.

... **Shift roles flexibly** - This calls in the need of a strong transfer of knowledge within the team. All three of us should be equipped to share hands with each other, if something or unfortunately, someone falls short.

![Plan_B_No1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Plan_B_No1.jpg " ") 

... **Go for the ‘Re-’s : Redesign and Reinvent** - If Google could, why not us? Going back all the way to Day 1 is not the essence but to intelligently know where to focus and how to.

![Plan_B_No2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Plan_B_No2.jpg " ")

... **Modularize and Prioritize** - Sounds easy but a hard road is ahead of us. We will take it small, really small. And we will fix which *small ones* are the relatively *big ones*.

Excited to be on-board in a pseudo-professional development process. We would keep you posted of how things go. Until next time, Cheers!

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,

-- **Team DroidSutra**
