# About our project

We, the team DroidSutra, are now working on a project for Bird tracking.

The aim is to develop an Android app which will be useful for Bird watchers. In case the user cites a specific bird, he/she can add this occurence with the app, add additional details or even link to more infomration about that.For those unsure about species, some easy-to-use guidance will also be provided. Moreover, the past observations data can be exported for sharing with others. 

More information about our challenges and progress can be found in the following blog!!
